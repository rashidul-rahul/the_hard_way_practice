Python follow PEMDAS for mathematical operations.
Here PEMDAS stand for:

P => Parenthesis
E => Exponential
M => Multiplication
D => Division
A => Addition
S => Subtraction

But it is not in a strict mode.
It actually do the Multiplication and Division in a same step from left to right,
Same the Addition and Subtraction do in same step.
So we can use it like this:
PEMDAS => PE(M&D)(A&S)
